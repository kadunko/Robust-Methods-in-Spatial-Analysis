The codes were written in MATLAB. There are five main functions: (i) bfsearch, (ii) pmainsequential, (iii) mestf, (iv) app1, and (v) app2.
    
(i) bfsearch.m generates results that were shown in Table 1, Figure 1, and Figure 2. 

(ii) pmainsequential.m generates results that were shown in Table 1, Figure 1, and Figure 2. 

(iii) mestf.m prepares results for the scenario n0=208 in Table 2. 

(iv) app1.m produces results that were displayed in Figures 3 and 4. 

(v) app2.m prepares results that were presented in Table 2, Table 3, Figure 5, and Figure 6.
